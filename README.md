# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This is the frontend of a ReactJS application that serves as the user interface for managing contact information. It allows users to perform the following operations:

Add new contacts.
View and manage a list of contacts with sorting and pagination.
Edit contact details.
Delete contacts.
Material-UI (MUI) is used for a consistent, responsive design, making the interface user-friendly.

## Setup Instructions and Available Scripts

### `git clone https://github.com/AnshAg111/Contact_mangement_system-frontend`  

Clone the repository

### cd frontend  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install'

Install dependencies using yarn

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# How it works

### Contact Form: 
Allows users to input new contact details. All fields are validated.

### Contacts Table: 
Displays the list of all contacts with columns for each attribute, action buttons, and features like sorting and pagination.

### Edit/Delete Actions: 
Users can update or delete a contact directly from the table.
